# Rust Crash Course

This is a quick and fairly broad set of documents to get you started learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This is targeted at people who already know at least one programming language, and have a working knowledge of common programming concepts, like lists, iteration, functions, etc.
It's intended to give a hard-and-fast practical overview of the language, focused on laying out common practical issues rather than diving deep into theoretical subjects.

This documentation was initially developed during the fall of 2019 at Keysight Technologies, in order to serve as support for an internal workshop on the Rust programming language.
